Pinafore/Apron: A crisp white, ruffled pinafore is worn over the blue dress. It has shoulder straps and a heart-shaped pockets on each side of the waist, which are outlined in black with a dark red interior and thin black lines radiating from the center, giving them a slight card-suit aesthetic.

Color Palette: Dominated by royal blue, crisp white, and bright red, with accents of gold/yellow.
Aesthetic Details: The prevalence of hearts (on pockets, in hand, possibly earrings), red bows, and the playing card she holds (Ace of Hearts) strongly connects her to the "Alice in Wonderland" theme, specifically the "Queen of Hearts" element.

Holding Card: She holds an "Ace of Hearts" playing card delicately between her thumb and forefinger, with the heart symbol clearly visible.
