Generation 1:
"prompt": "A 9:16 vertical video in a hyper-stylized cell-shaded 3D anime aesthetic reminiscent of 'Killer is Dead', featuring dramatic cel-shading, bold black outlines, and stark chiaroscuro lighting. The primary colors are royal blue, white, red, and gold.\n\n[cut] A low-angle wide shot of a quaint, surreal cottage under a stark white sky. An anxious, anthropomorphic White Rabbit in a vibrant blue coat and top hat stands by the door, checking a golden pocketwatch.\n\n[cut] A young woman, Alice, with bright golden blonde wavy hair, large blue eyes, a royal blue dress, and a white pinafore apron, walks gracefully into the frame from the right, her red Mary Jane shoes silent on the grass.\n\n[cut] A medium shot of the White Rabbit looking up, startled by Alice's arrival, his ears twitching."

Generation 2:
"prompt": "Continuing the scene in a 9:16 vertical video with the 'Killer is Dead' cell-shaded 3D anime aesthetic. Maintain high-contrast lighting, bold outlines, and the royal blue/white/red color scheme. Alice has golden blonde hair and a royal blue dress; the White Rabbit wears a blue coat.\n\n[cut] Extreme close-up on the White Rabbit's panicked face. He looks at Alice, then back at his golden pocketwatch, muttering silently.\n\n[cut] The White Rabbit gestures frantically towards the cottage door, pointing assertively as if giving a command, mistaking Alice for his maid.\n\n[cut] Medium shot of Alice, who looks slightly confused but gives a small, obedient curtsy before turning and walking towards the open cottage door."

Generation 3:
"prompt": "Continuing the scene in a 9:16 vertical video, maintaining the 'Killer is Dead' cell-shaded 3D anime style. The interior of the cottage is dark, with dramatic shafts of light. Alice, with golden blonde hair and a royal blue dress, is the focus.\n\n[cut] Point-of-view shot from Alice's perspective as she steps into the dimly lit, dusty cottage. The room is sparse, with exaggerated shadows.\n\n[cut] The camera pans to a small wooden table where a single, ornate glass bottle sits, catching a dramatic beam of light. The liquid inside glows faintly.\n\n[cut] A tight shot of Alice's hand picking up the bottle, her face showing curiosity. She uncorks it and brings it to her lips, tilting her head back to drink."

Generation 4:
"prompt": "Continuing the scene in a 9:16 vertical video, using the high-contrast 'Killer is Dead' cell-shaded 3D anime style. The scene escalates dramatically. Alice has golden blonde hair and a royal blue dress.\n\n[cut] Extreme close-up on Alice’s wide blue eye reflecting the room as the camera begins to shudder and low-frequency sound design begins. The room appears to shrink around her.\n\n[cut] A disorienting, ultra-wide low-angle shot from the floor of the cottage as Alice grows at a rapid pace, her limbs comically and awkwardly filling the entire space.\n\n[cut] Cut to an exterior shot of the cottage; the walls are bulging, and its windows crack under pressure. A giant, beautifully rendered arm in a blue sleeve bursts out of a window, waving helplessly."

Generation 5:
"prompt": "Continuing the scene in a 9:16 vertical video, maintaining the 'Killer is Dead' cell-shaded 3D anime aesthetic with bold outlines and stark lighting. The action is outside the cottage where Alice is now a giant.\n\n[cut] A low-angle shot from the ground, showing a badger in a waistcoat and a squirrel looking up in terror at the house-filling 'monster'.\n\n[cut] The badger picks up a small pebble and flings it in a high arc towards the cottage window where Alice's arm is stuck.\n\n[cut] An extreme close-up slow-motion shot follows the pebble as it flies through the air, magically and smoothly transforming into a tiny, perfectly frosted cake with a red cherry on top."

Generation 6:
"prompt": "Continuing the scene in a 9:16 vertical video, maintaining the 'Killer is Dead' cell-shaded 3D anime style. Alice is still gigantic inside the cottage.\n\n[cut] A close-up on Alice's giant, curious face peering out of a window. Her giant hand gently catches one of the tiny flying cakes.\n\n[cut] She eats the cake. The camera executes a rapid dolly-out/zoom-in 'Vertigo effect' centered on her face. The world appears to lurch and expand as she shrinks down rapidly, a whirlwind of motion and color.\n\n[cut] A ground-level wide shot. A normal-sized Alice, looking dazed, runs out of the now enormous-looking cottage doorway and dashes into a field of tall, swaying grass."

Generation 7:
"prompt": "Final scene in a 9:16 vertical video, maintaining the hyper-stylized 'Killer is Dead' cell-shaded 3D anime aesthetic. Alice, with golden blonde hair and a royal blue dress, walks into a new environment.\n\n[cut] Alice hesitantly walks from the sunny field into the treeline of a dark, surreal forest where the trees have stark black outlines.\n\n[cut] As she walks deeper, the scene becomes a psychedelic trip. The trees and giant mushrooms around her bizarrely grow and shrink. The colors of the foliage pulsate and shift through a vibrant, hallucinatory spectrum of deep blues, purples, and reds.\n\n[cut] A final dolly zoom on Alice’s bewildered face, her large blue eyes wide, reflecting the chaotic, shifting colors and shapes of the psychedelic forest around her."
