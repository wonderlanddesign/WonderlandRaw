Character's Appearance, Clothing, Hairstyle, and Facial Features:

Character: The character is a young woman, posed in a slightly dynamic stance, holding an Ace of Hearts playing card in her left hand. Her expression is a confident, slight smirk.
Hairstyle: She has long, wavy blonde hair that reaches her waist, parted on the side and cascading over her shoulders and back. There are a few stray strands framing her face.
Facial Features:
Eyes: Her eyes are a striking blue, large and expressive, characteristic of anime art. They have dark pupils and a subtle highlight to imply shine. Eyelashes are prominent.
Eyebrows: Thin, dark blonde eyebrows are slightly arched to match her expression.
Nose: A small, delicate nose is subtly rendered with minimal lines.
Mouth: Her lips are a light pink, curved into a confident, closed-mouth smirk.
Cheeks: There's a faint blush on her cheeks.
Clothing:
Dress: She wears a classic maid-style dress. The main body of the dress is a vibrant royal blue, with short, puffy sleeves that have ruffled white cuffs. The skirt is full and layered, reaching above her knees, with a black petticoat or underskirt visible underneath the blue fabric. There's a subtle gold trim detail around the bottom edge of the blue skirt.
Apron: A white, ruffled apron covers the front of her dress. It has two heart-shaped pockets on the lower front, each featuring a red heart with a black accent, encircled by a ruffled border.
Accessories:
Hair Bow: A large, prominent bright red bow is tied atop her head, adding a whimsical touch.
Neck Bow: A smaller red bow is tied at her neck, matching the one in her hair.
Earrings: She wears small, cherry-red stud earrings.
Gloves/Cuffs: White cuffs with ruffles are visible under the blue sleeves, at her wrists.
Stockings/Garters: She wears white thigh-high stockings. On her upper thighs, a red ribbon is tied around each stocking with a bow, and yellowish garters with gold clasps are visible, suggesting the stockings are held up by a garter belt beneath her dress (though the belt itself is not shown).
Shoes: She wears red Mary Jane-style high heels with a black sole and a small red bow on the strap.
Playing Card: She holds an "Ace of Hearts" playing card in her left hand, which is rendered with classic card art: a large red 'A' in the corner and a single prominent red heart in the center.
Color Palette:

The color palette is primary and bold, dominated by:

Blues: Vibrant royal blue for the main dress.
Reds: Bright red for the bows, earrings, shoes, hearts on the apron, and the playing card.
Whites: Clean white for the apron, cuffs, stockings, and collar.
Blacks: Strong black outlines and solid black for shading (especially prominent on the legs and underskirt), providing stark contrast.
Yellow/Gold: Soft blonde for hair, a hint of yellow for the garters, and a thin gold trim on the skirt.
Skin Tone: A fair, natural skin tone with subtle pinking for cheeks and lips.
Eyes: Clear blue.
Anime Cel-Shaded Art Style Characteristics:

The image strongly exhibits characteristics of anime cel-shaded art, often seen in video games (like the "Persona" series, which this style strongly resembles) or traditional animation:

Bold Outlines: The most striking feature is the thick, consistent black outlines around all characters and clothing elements, giving them a distinct, graphic quality.
Flat Colors: Colors are applied in large, unmodulated blocks, with little to no smooth gradients. This creates a clean, graphic look.
Hard Shading: Shading is achieved with sharp, defined edges between different tones of the same color (or sometimes different colors entirely, like the black shading on the legs). There are no soft or blended shadows. Shadows are often stark and geometric.
Exaggerated Features: While not overly exaggerated, the large, expressive eyes and sleek character design are typical of anime.
Dynamic Posing: The character is in a dynamic, slightly angled pose, which adds to the lively and animated feel.
Limited Color Palette (within shaded areas): For any given light source and basic color, there are usually only 2-3 distinct shades used (base color, one lighter highlight, one darker shadow), emphasizing the hard-edged look.
Glossy Highlights: Subtle, bright white highlights are strategically placed on hair, eyes, and shoes to indicate shininess and volume without using gradients.
Clean and Crisp: The overall aesthetic is very clean, crisp, and graphic, due to the high contrast and clear separation of colors and shapes.
Overall, this "Alice" character reference is a vibrant, stylish representation, combining the classic maid aesthetic with a bold, modern anime art style.
