video script:

In a psychedelic forest, Alice stumbled upon a blue Caterpillar. Rings of smoke twisted from his hookah. 'Who are you?' he rasped. Confused, she couldn't answer. He offered a riddle: the mushroom. One side to grow, one to shrink. She took a piece of each. Her neck shot up past the trees, then she shrank in a dizzying rush. Finally, she found her balance and walked into the dark. A purple, glowing Cheshire Cat appeared on a branch. 'We're all mad here,' he purred, vanishing until only his crazed smile remained.

Style Design: The video will be in a 16:9 aspect ratio, animated in a sharp, high-contrast anime style inspired by "Killer is Dead." This includes bold, heavy black outlines, hard-edged cel-shading with no gradients, and a vibrant, yet dark color palette. The atmosphere will be surreal and psychedelic, utilizing stark shadows, dramatic lighting effects, and bizarre, glitch-like visual transitions to create a feeling of stylish disorientation.

character design(Optional): Character design is not required as a detailed description for Alice was provided by the user. The design will consistently adhere to: long wavy blonde hair, blue eyes, a blue maid-style dress with a white ruffled apron, a red bow in her hair, white stockings, and red Mary Jane heels, all rendered in the specified "Killer is Dead" art style.

Storyboard design: Scene 1: Narration: In a psychedelic forest, Alice stumbled upon a blue Caterpillar. Rings of smoke twisted from his hookah. 'Who are you?' he rasped. (23 words) Visual Description: Low-angle shot. Alice, rendered with bold outlines and flat colors, looks up at a massive, pulsating mushroom. Atop it sits the Caterpillar, shrouded in deep noir-style shadows. His multiple arms hold a glowing hookah. The smoke rings he blows are neon magenta, forming sharp, geometric shapes that float menacingly towards the camera before dissipating.

Scene 2: Narration: Confused, she couldn't answer. He offered a riddle: the mushroom. One side to grow, one to shrink. She took a piece of each. (23 words) Visual Description: Extreme close-up on Alice's wide, confused blue eye, which reflects the Caterpillar's silhouette. Quick cut to a shot from over the Caterpillar's shoulder as he points. The two sides of the mushroom glow intensely—one with a harsh cyan light, the other with a deep crimson. Alice’s hand, sharply outlined in black, breaks off two pieces.

Scene 3: Narration: Her neck shot up past the trees, then she shrank in a dizzying rush. Finally, she found her balance and walked into the dark. (23 words) Visual Description: A rapid, disorienting montage. First, a vertiginous shot from the ground looking up as Alice's neck stretches unnaturally fast into a swirling, psychedelic sky. This is followed by a high-angle shot where she shrinks violently. The scene ends with a steady medium shot of a normal-sized Alice walking into a forest of stark black tree silhouettes against a dark purple sky.

Scene 4: Narration: A purple, glowing Cheshire Cat appeared on a branch. 'We're all mad here,' he purred, vanishing until only his crazed smile remained. (24 words) Visual Description: In the darkness, a wide, disembodied grin of glowing lilac light appears first. The Cheshire Cat's body, striped in vibrant purples, fades into existence around it. His eyes glow a piercing yellow. As he speaks, his body flickers and distorts like a video glitch. He then dissolves into black particles, leaving only the immense, isolated grin hanging in the air.
