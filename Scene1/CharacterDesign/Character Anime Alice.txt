Character Anime Alice

Appearance

Body Type She has a slender and youthful build, characteristic of many anime female characters. Her limbs are delicately proportioned.
Skin Tone Her skin appears fair, with a healthy flush on her cheeks.
Clothing Style She is dressed in a playful and somewhat provocative maid's costume, heavily inspired by the traditional Alice in Wonderland aesthetic but with a modern, anime flair.

Dress A vibrant royal blue short puff-sleeved dress forms the base. It features a ruffled hemline with a thin white trim. The sleeves are also ruffled at the cuffs.
Apron Over the blue dress, she wears a white ruffled apron. The apron has two distinctive heart-shaped pockets, outlined in black with a red interior that has a black diagonal grid pattern, suggesting a playing card motif.
CollarBow A white collar with a red bow tie adorns her neck.
GarterStockings She wears white thigh-high stockings. The tops of these stockings are held up by suspender-style straps, possibly attached to a garter belt, in a light yellowgold color with small red bows tied to the front of the stockings. This detail adds a slightly mature and playful element to the otherwise innocent costume.
Shoes Red mary jane style shoes with small red bows on the straps complete her footwear.
Hair Color and Style

Color Her hair is a bright, clear blonde, with highlights suggesting light reflection.
Style It's long, flowing, and styled in gentle waves or curls, particularly around her shoulders and chest. A large, prominent bright red bow is tied to the top of her head, pulling back some of her hair, likely a headband or hair tie. A few strands of hair frame her face.
Facial Features

Eyes Her most striking feature. They are large, wide, and expressive, a hallmark of anime style. The irises are a captivating light blue, possibly with a subtle gradient, and reflect light prominently. She has long, dark eyelashes.
Eyebrows Thin, dark, and gently arched above her eyes.
Nose Small and delicate, with minimal detail, typical for anime characters to maintain a youthful and idealized appearance.
Mouth Her lips are full and painted a vibrant red. She has a slight, inviting smile, revealing a hint of teeth. There's a subtle red blush on her cheeks.
Ears Not visible, covered by hair.
Accessories She holds a red Ace of Hearts playing card in her left hand, which further reinforces the Alice in Wonderland theme and hints at potential gameplay or a card-related power.
Overall Aesthetic The character presents a fantasy anime aesthetic with a strong Alice in Wonderland theme, infused with a touch of maid cosplay and possibly some Persona or similar JRPG design influences due to the bold outlines and clean, impactful color choices. She is designed to be appealing and dynamic, with youthful charm combined with subtle mature elements (like the garter straps). The strong black outlines and bold, flat colors (with subtle cell-shaded gradients) are extremely characteristic of a cell-shaded 3D anime video game style, making her an excellent reference. She projects an aura of playful mystery and readiness for adventure.
