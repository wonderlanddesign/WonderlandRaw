segments: Generation 1: "prompt": "<prompt>A cell-shaded 3D anime video in the aesthetic of Killer is Dead, 9:16 aspect ratio. The scene is a rain-slicked city street at night, with stark shadows cast by neon signs. An anxious white rabbit in a waistcoat stands in the middle of the road under a single streetlight. [cut] Extreme close-up on a gold pocket watch held by the white rabbit, ticking rapidly. The rabbit's gloved hand is trembling. Pull back to a medium shot as he frantically looks around the empty street. [cut] A stylish blonde woman (long flowing blonde hair with a large red bow, bright blue eyes, wearing a blue dress with white apron, white thigh-high stockings, and red mary jane shoes) stops on the sidewalk, her eyes wide with surprise as she sees the rabbit. [cut] The rabbit bolts. A dynamic, low-angle tracking shot follows the rabbit as it sprints away, with the blonde woman starting to chase after him in the background. The style features high contrast noir lighting, deep shadows, and bold black outlines.</prompt>"

Generation 2: "prompt": "<prompt>Continuing the cell-shaded 3D anime video in the aesthetic of Killer is Dead, 9:16 aspect ratio. The blonde woman (long flowing blonde hair, red bow, blue dress, white apron) is chasing the anxious white rabbit down the dark city street. [cut] A shimmering, swirling wormhole of iridescent color materializes on the street ahead. The white rabbit, without hesitation, leaps dramatically into the portal. [cut] The blonde woman can't stop in time, her red mary jane shoes skidding on the wet pavement as she tumbles headfirst into the wormhole right after him. [cut] Inside the wormhole, a surreal shot shows them falling through a twisting, psychedelic tunnel. The camera spins lazily around them as they float past giant chess pieces, glowing oversized mushrooms, and impossible, twisting staircases. The style maintains its high-contrast, bold-outlined, surreal fantasy look.</prompt>"

Generation 3: "prompt": "<prompt>End of the chase sequence in a cell-shaded 3D anime style, aesthetic of Killer is Dead, 9:16 aspect ratio. The blonde woman (long flowing blonde hair, red bow, blue dress, white apron) and the white rabbit are falling out of a wormhole. [cut] They land with a soft thud on a bed of glowing moss in a massive, surreal fantasy forest at night. Towering, bioluminescent trees pulse with a soft light, and giant, strange mushrooms dot the landscape. The rabbit lands perfectly on its feet. [cut] The rabbit immediately scrambles up, gives a final panicked look back at the woman, and darts away, disappearing between the glowing tree trunks. [cut] The blonde woman slowly pushes herself up, looking confused and calling out. The camera then pulls back into a wide, awe-inspiring shot, showing her as a small, solitary figure in the vast, humming, and mysterious glowing forest, completely alone.</prompt>"
