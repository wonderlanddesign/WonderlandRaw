Character 1: Alice-like Girl
Appearance: The character is a young woman, likely in her late teens or early twenties, with fair skin. She has a slender but shapely figure.

Clothing:

Dress: She wears a classic blue maid-style dress (or "Alice" dress) with a full, pleated skirt that reaches mid-thigh. The dress is a vibrant royal blue with white trim on the edges of the skirt.
Apron: Over the blue dress, she wears a white apron with ruffled edges. The apron has two large heart-shaped pockets adorned with black outlines and red hearts inside, creating a striking contrast.
Sleeves: Her sleeves are short and puffed, also trimmed with white ruffles.
Collar & Bow: A prominent red bow is tied at her neck, matching the large red bow in her hair. Below the bow is a white collar with ruffles.
Stockings & Garters: She wears white thigh-high stockings, which are held up by yellow garters on her thighs. Each garter has a small red bow tied on the outside.
Shoes: Her shoes are red Mary Janes with visible straps, also featuring small red bows on the top of the foot.
Accessories: She holds an Ace of Hearts playing card in her left hand, positioned as if showing it to an audience.
Hair Style:

Her hair is long and wavy, flowing down past her shoulders. It is a bright, sunny blonde color.
A large, prominent red bow is tied on top of her head, pulling back some of her bangs and letting other pieces frame her face.
Facial Features:

Eyes: Her eyes are large and expressive, a striking blue color that complements her dress. They have black pupils, and a subtle light reflection gives them depth. Eyelashes are prominent and dark.
Eyebrows: Her eyebrows are thin and dark blonde, matching her hair color.
Nose: Her nose is small and delicately drawn.
Mouth: Her lips are full and painted a light red/pink, with a slight smile.
Expression: Her expression is one of gentle allure and perhaps a hint of mischief, given the playing card accessory.
Overall Visual Style (Alice-like Girl): The character embodies a modern, somewhat stylized anime aesthetic. The use of strong black outlines, bright and saturated colors, and sharp highlights creates a dynamic and appealing look. The combination of classic Alice in Wonderland elements with modern touches (like the thigh-highs and garters) gives her a playful and slightly alluring persona.

Character 2: White Rabbit
Appearance: This character is an anthropomorphic white rabbit, standing upright.

Clothing:

Suit: He is dressed in a smart, well-tailored royal blue suit. The suit jacket features deep blue shading and hints of lighter blue for highlights, giving it a glossy appearance.
Vest: Underneath the jacket, he wears a gold waistcoat (vest) with buttons.
Shirt & Bow Tie: He has a white ruffled shirt and a matching royal blue bow tie.
Hat: He sports a black top hat with a dark blue band around it.
Hair/Fur:

His fur is predominantly white on his face, chest, belly, and paws.
Dark black fur covers his ears (with pink insides), the back of his head, and his back and legs. There are some white patches on his forearms and shins.
He has prominent black whiskers.
Facial Features:

Eyes: His eyes are relatively small, black, and round, with a reddish-pink iris/sclera, giving them an intense gaze. This red contrasting with the primarily white and black fur makes them stand out.
Nose: His nose is a small, pink, inverted triangle.
Mouth: His mouth is a simple line, with slightly visible teeth, suggesting a slight underbite or typical rabbit mouth structure.
Ears: His ears are long and upright, with pink insides.
Expression: The rabbit's expression is serious and focused, emphasizing his role as the hurried timekeeper.
Overall Visual Style (White Rabbit): The White Rabbit shares the same bold outline and cel-shaded aesthetic as the Alice-like character. The vibrant blue of his suit stands out against his white and black fur. The detailed pocket watch, with its golden chain, is a classic motif that immediately identifies him. His posture and the act of holding the watch convey urgency and importance.

Unified Visual Style: Both characters are designed with a consistent visual language: sharp, clean lines, vibrant color palettes, and a distinct lack of subtle gradients or textures, favoring flat color fields with hard-edged highlights and shadows. This style is often seen in modern animation, video games, or digital illustrations that aim for a crisp, striking appearance.
