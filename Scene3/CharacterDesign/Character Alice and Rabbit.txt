Character 1: Alice (left side)

Appearance: This character is clearly inspired by Alice from "Alice in Wonderland," but with a modern, somewhat alluring, and dramatic anime twist.
Hair: She has long, wavy blonde hair that reaches past her shoulders. A prominent, large red bow is tied at the top of her head, adding a playful touch.
Facial Features: Her face is drawn with classic anime features: large, expressive blue eyes with prominent eyelashes, a small nose, and plump red lips. She has a faint blush on her cheeks. She also wears small, red stud earrings.
Clothing: Her attire is a highly stylized maid outfit, featuring the iconic blue and white color scheme of Alice.
Dress: A short, puffy-sleeved blue dress forms the base, with white cuff details.
Apron: Over the blue dress, she wears a white maid's apron with ruffled edges. The apron is adorned with two large, black heart shapes outlined in white, each containing a smaller red heart in the center, hinting at the "Queen of Hearts" theme.
Bow: A red bow is tied at the neck of her dress, complementing the bow in her hair and the hearts on her apron.
Accessories:
She wears white, thigh-high stockings or socks, held up by yellow garter straps that are visible. Red bows adorn the top sides of her stockings.
Her shoes are red Mary Janes with chunky heels and matching red bows on the straps.
Pose and Props: She stands with one hand gently holding up a playing card, specifically the Ace of Hearts, which perfectly ties into the Wonderland theme and suggests a connection to the Queen of Hearts. Her posture is slightly dynamic, and she has a gentle, inviting expression.
Overall Aesthetic: The character combines innocence with a mature, fashion-forward sensibility. The bold outlines and shiny highlights give her a sleek, almost vinyl-like appearance.
Character 2: The White Rabbit (right side)

Appearance: This is a bipedal, anthropomorphic rabbit, instantly recognizable as the White Rabbit through its classic accoutrements.
Fur and Ears: The rabbit has predominantly white fur on its face, chest, and lower body/paws, contrasting with black fur on its back, arms, and ear tips. Its ears are long and upright, with pinkish-red inner ear details. Its eyes are red, giving it a somewhat intense look.
Facial Features: It has typical rabbit features such as a twitching nose (implied by the style), whiskers, and a slightly open mouth showing a hint of teeth. Its gaze is directed towards the pocket watch it holds.
Clothing: The rabbit is impeccably dressed in formal attire:
Coat: A rich blue tailcoat, detailed with lighter blue highlights to show depth and shine.
Vest and Shirt: Beneath the coat, it wears a dark blue waistcoat (vest) and a ruffled white shirt.
Bowtie: A matching blue bowtie completes the formal look.
Hat: A tall, black top hat with a blue band sits on its head, a quintessential element of its character.
Pose and Props: The rabbit stands upright, holding a gold pocket watch with a visible chain dangling from it. Its pose suggests urgency and a preoccupation with time, true to its famous line, "I'm late, I'm late for a very important date!"
Overall Aesthetic: Like Alice, the White Rabbit is rendered with strong lines and high contrast, giving it a polished and slightly dramatic appearance. The regal blue and gold colors enhance its distinguished but harried demeanor.
Overall Artistic Style:

Both characters share a consistent art style characterized by:

Clean Linework: Bold, crisp black outlines define all shapes and features.
Vibrant Colors: Saturated and bright colors are used, with strong shading and highlights (often in stark white or lighter blues/reds) to create a sense of depth and glossy texture.
Anime/Manga Influence: Exaggerated features, expressive eyes, and dynamic posing are evident. The style has a definite professional illustrative quality, making it suitable for concept art, merchandise, or character design for games/animation.
Thematic Consistency: Both characters are instantly identifiable despite the stylistic interpretation, and their design elements (cards, hearts, pocket watch, bows) reinforce the "Alice in Wonderland" theme.
