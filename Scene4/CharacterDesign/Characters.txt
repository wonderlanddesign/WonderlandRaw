There's a fascinating blend of styles here, leaning heavily into anime/manga influences with a touch of gothic and fantastical elements.

Anime/Manga Foundation: All human-like characters (Alice, Mad Hatter) exhibit typical anime proportions (large eyes, slender bodies, spiky or detailed hair), strong outlines, and expressive features.
Stylized Realism (for Animals): While still featuring strong outlines, the animal characters (White Rabbit, Cheshire Cat) have more exaggerated features and textures compared to pure anime characters, but are still highly stylized.
Strong Outlines: A consistent feature across all images is the use of thick, definitive outlines to separate elements and give a comic-book or cel-art feel.
High Contrast: Even without explicit cel-shading yet, the images show a good degree of contrast, separating light and shadow areas clearly.
Fantastical & Whimsical: The overall aesthetic is whimsical and draws heavily from Alice in Wonderland lore, albeit with a darker, more stylistic twist.
"Killer is Dead" Anime Cel-Shading Style Elements (Incorporation):
The "Killer is Dead" style is characterized by:

Hard, Geometric Shadows: Shadows are often simplified into broad, angular shapes, rather than soft gradients. There's usually a clear distinction between the lit and shadowed areas.
Strong Silhouettes: The characters should read well even as dark silhouettes due to clear outlines and distinct shapes.
Limited Color Palette (per area): While the overall palette can be rich, individual shaded areas often use flat colors with little to no gradient within the shadow itself.
Dramatic Lighting: Lighting isn't always naturalistic; it's often used to create mood, emphasize form, and add dynamic flair. This can lead to exaggerated highlights and shadows.
Exaggerated Features & Proportions: Fits well with the existing anime influences.
To apply this to these characters, we'd take the existing base colors and add these hard, angular shadow shapes, often with a slightly desaturated or darker version of the base color. Highlights would also be sharp and distinct.

Character-Specific Analysis:
1. The Mad Hatter (Based on the image)
Art Style Characteristics: Definitely anime/manga. High detail in the hair and clothing. A slightly gothic or darker aesthetic with sharp, angular features, especially in the face.
Character Design:
Appearance: Long, flowing, somewhat spiky purple/blue-tinted hair covering one eye. Pale skin. A wide, unsettling grin with sharp-looking teeth. Very long, slender fingers.
Attire: A very tall, elaborate top hat with a "10/6" tag, ripped fabric, and possibly feathers or intricate adornments. A striped suit jacket with oversized shoulder pads or ruffled sleeves. A bow tie. A waistcoat.
Prop: Holding an ornate teapot and pouring tea into a small, delicate teacup that seems to be held by a small, tentacled creature or a very small, elaborate stand. Stack of mismatched teacups in vibrant, yet slightly muted, colors.
Color Palette: Dominated by deep blues, purples, and blacks for clothing and hair, creating a somber yet elegant feel. The skin is pale. The teacups introduce splashes of brighter, almost pastel, colors (blue, pink, green, yellow) but still with an antique/worn quality. The liquid tea is a warm brown.
Visual Aesthetics: Elegant, mysterious, slightly sinister. The wide grin and glowing eyes suggest a mischievous or potentially unhinged personality. The ornate clothing and tea set add to the whimsical yet dark fantasy vibe.
"Killer is Dead" Elements:
Shadows: Shadows on the suit, hair, and hat would be very crisp and angular, perhaps using a darker shade of the deep blues/purples.
Highlights: Sharp, almost glowing highlights on the metallic teapot, the teacup's edge, and potentially strands of his hair. His eyes already have a glow effect that could be enhanced.
Outline: Maintain the strong, thick outlines.
Distinct Features for Consistency:
The elongated, wild hair with its specific tint.
The exaggerated, Cheshire-like grin with sharp teeth.
The distinctive top hat with its "10/6" tag and tattered look.
The striped, oversized suit jacket and bow tie.
The overall slender and slightly eerie silhouette.
2. The March Hare (Represented by the White Rabbit with a Top Hat)
Art Style Characteristics: Cartoonish yet detailed. Strong, clean lines typical of cel animation or comic art. Expressive eyes.
Character Design:
Appearance: Anthro-rabbit with prominent ears, a bushy tail, and large, expressive red eyes. White fur with dark patches on limbs and underbelly.
Attire: A crisp, shiny blue suit jacket, waistcoat, and bow tie. A dark blue top hat with a lighter blue band. Gold chain visible.
Prop: Holding a golden pocket watch with a chain.
Color Palette: Predominantly black, white, and a vibrant, somewhat metallic blue for the suit. Accents of gold for the watch and chain, and red for the eyes and perhaps inside the ears.
Visual Aesthetics: Dapper, punctual, and classic "Alice in Wonderland." The sharp suit and watch evoke organization and urgency.
"Killer is Dead" Elements:
Shadows: Extremely hard-edged and geometric, especially on the suit jacket to emphasize its folds and structure. Use a darker, desaturated blue for shadows.
Highlights: Very sharp, reflective highlights on the blue suit (especially the shoulders and lapels) and the gold pocket watch, giving it a somewhat metallic, almost plastic quality in places.
Outline: Very strong black outlines, especially around the white fur to define its shape.
Distinct Features for Consistency:
The specific shade of blue for the suit and hat.
The golden pocket watch and chain.
The large, red, expressive eyes.
The clear division between white and dark fur sections.
The overall sharp, upright silhouette with prominent ears.
3. Alice
Art Style Characteristics: Modern anime/manga influence, reminiscent of Persona series character designs. Bold outlines, clean coloring, and high contrast. Expressive yet somewhat serious facial features.
Character Design:
Appearance: Blonde hair styled in large curls, tied with a red bow. Blue eyes. Slender, feminine build.
Attire: Classic Alice maid outfit, but heavily stylized. A vibrant blue dress with white puffed sleeves, apron, and ruffled hem. Red bows on the sleeves, garter straps, and shoes. White thigh-high stockings with red ribbon garters. Details like heart embellishments on the apron pockets.
Prop: Holding an Ace of Hearts playing card.
Color Palette: Dominant vibrant blues and reds, contrasted with stark white (apron, stockings). Blonde hair provides a warm accent. Black is used for outlines and deep shadows.
Visual Aesthetics: "Cute but dangerous" or "innocent with an edge." The red accents and the Ace of Hearts suggest a strong, perhaps mischievous, personality beneath the innocent maid facade.
"Killer is Dead" Elements:
Shadows: Very sharp, angular shadows on the dress folds, under the chin, and on the hair. Use darker, slightly desaturated versions of the vibrant blues and reds. Shadow on skin could be a light, greenish-grey or purple-grey, typical of some anime styles.
Highlights: Sharp, small highlights on the hair curls, the plastic-like sheen of the red shoes, and the fabric of the bows.
Outline: The existing strong black outlines are perfect for this style.
Distinct Features for Consistency:
The specific modern take on the Alice maid dress (colors, heart details, red bow accents).
The distinct blonde curly hair with the prominent red bow.
The slender, slightly mature facial structure.
The Ace of Hearts card.
4. The Dormouse (Implied by a small, cute character, no explicit image of dormouse so I'll interpret based on "Alice in Wonderland" dormouse characteristics) (Correction: The provided image is the Cheshire Cat, not the Dormouse. I will analyze the Cheshire Cat.)
Let's correct and analyze the Cheshire Cat instead, as it's clearly depicted.

The Cheshire Cat
Art Style Characteristics: Whimsical, illustrative, watercolor-like with strong ink outlines. More organic and furry texture compared to the other characters. Exaggerated features typical of a fantastical creature.
Character Design:
Appearance: Fluffy, chunky cat with a distinctive pattern of pink and light blue stripes. Extremely wide, unsettling grin showing many sharp teeth. Large, glowing blue/yellow eyes with small pupils. Curling whiskers. Fluffy ears.
Attire: A small, pink bow tie with lighter pink polka dots.
Color Palette: Soft pastels of pink and light blue for the fur, contrasting with vibrant, almost neon, blue and yellow for the eyes. The mouth is dark, almost black, with stark white teeth. The bow tie adds a pop of pink.
Visual Aesthetics: Ethereal, mysterious, and iconic "Alice in Wonderland" whimsy with a slightly unsettling edge due to the grin. The watercolor texture gives it a dreamlike quality.
"Killer is Dead" Elements (Adaptation needed due to original style):
Shadows: This is where the style diverges most. To fit KiD, the soft watercolor shading would be replaced with hard, angular shadow shapes, even on the fur. Shadows on the pink areas would be a darker, flat pink; on blue, a darker flat blue.
Highlights: Sharp, geometric highlights could be applied to the fur, particularly on the rounded parts of the body and head, making it look almost sculptural. The eyes already have a bright, 'glowing' quality that can be intensified with sharp highlights.
Outline: Maintain the thick, rougher ink outlines, but perhaps make them a bit more consistently solid.
Texture: The fur texture would be conveyed less by subtle shading and more by the distinct placement of shadow shapes, or through a subtle, stylized texture map if 3D, rather than the painterly brushstrokes.
Distinct Features for Consistency:
The unique pink and blue stripe pattern across the fur.
The iconic extremely wide, toothy grin.
The large, glowing blue and yellow eyes.
The small, polka-dotted pink bow tie.
The overall puffy/fluffy silhouette, even with hard shadows.
By applying "Killer is Dead" cel-shading principles (hard shadows, sharp highlights, strong outlines, and potentially dramatic lighting) to these distinct character designs and color palettes, a cohesive and stylistically unified "Alice in Wonderland" universe can be created while still retaining the original charm and features of each character. The key is to transform the existing rendering into flat, graphic planes of color for shadow and
