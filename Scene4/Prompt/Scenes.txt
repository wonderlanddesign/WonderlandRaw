video script: EXT. FOREST CLEARING – DAY A long, impossibly stretched tea table sits under a twisting tree. Cups, saucers, crumbs, teapots, broken clocks, and half-buttered slices of bread clutter every inch.

ALICE, cautious but curious, steps forward. At the head of the table sit the MAD HATTER and MARCH HARE, mid-argument. The DORMOUSE sleeps between them, slumped in a teapot like it's a pillow.

MARCH HARE: "No room! No room!" ALICE: "But there's plenty of room..." She sits anyway. The Hatter leans in dramatically, studying her face like a puzzle.

MARCH HARE: "Tea?" He hands her a cup already filled with crumbs.

ALICE: "I haven't had any yet, so—how can I have more?" MAD HATTER: "You mean you can't have less. It's easy to have more of nothing!" The Hatter bursts into chaotic laughter. The Hare joins in. The Dormouse snorts in its sleep.

MAD HATTER: "Tell us your riddle! If you don't have one, we'll give you one." ALICE: "I don't think—" MARCH HARE: "Then you shouldn't talk!" They laugh again, delighted by their own joke.

MAD HATTER: "Very well. Why is a raven like a writing desk?" He waits with great anticipation. Alice considers it seriously.

ALICE: "I think I could figure that out..." Time passes. The Hatter drums impatiently. The Hare drips tea onto the Dormouse's ears.

MAD HATTER: "Have you guessed the answer yet?" ALICE: "No, I give up. What's the answer?" MAD HATTER: "I haven't the slightest idea." Alice stares at him, incredulous.

ALICE: "That's not a riddle at all!" MAD HATTER: "Of course it is. Time and I fell out, you see. Ever since, he's refused to do what I ask." He holds up a battered pocket watch.

MAD HATTER: "Time has stopped at precisely six o'clock. Eternally tea-time. A masterpiece of misery!" MARCH HARE: "Wonderful, isn't it?" ALICE: "But doesn't that mean you never… finish?" MAD HATTER: "Exactly! So when the table fills with dirty dishes—we simply move down one seat! Genius!" They all slide one chair down the table. Crumbs spill everywhere. The Dormouse rolls a few inches, still asleep.

ALICE: "This is the most ridiculous tea party I've ever been to!" MAD HATTER: "Thank you." MARCH HARE: "We try." ALICE: "I think I'll be going now." Her vision gets blurry, everything around her starts to melt, she faints.

FADE OUT.

Style Design: Anime Cel-Shaded "Killer is Dead" aesthetic. This style is defined by its dramatic and high-contrast visuals. Key elements include:

Lighting: Chiaroscuro lighting with hard, geometrically-shaped shadows that often fall across characters' faces and the environment.
Color Palette: Limited and stylized. Each area or scene is dominated by a few bold, often non-naturalistic colors (e.g., a blood-red sky, a deep purple forest) to create a strong mood.
Silhouettes: Characters and objects have strong, clean silhouettes that stand out against the background.
Character Features: Exaggerated and angular features, especially in expressions of madness, surprise, or anger.
Overall Feel: A slick, violent, and hyper-stylized punk-noir atmosphere.
character design(Optional): Character design is not required as reference images for Alice, the Mad Hatter, and the March Hare have been provided. The designs will be adapted to fit the specified "Killer is Dead" style, emphasizing angular lines and dramatic shadows.

Storyboard design: Scene 1 (8s) Narration: (VOICEOVER) "A long, impossibly stretched tea table sits under a twisting tree, cluttered with the remnants of an endless, chaotic party." Visual Description: Extreme wide shot. A warped, impossibly long table stretches towards the horizon. A gnarled, black tree with no leaves twists above it. The scene is cast in a deep blue and black palette, with harsh white light hitting the edges of teacups and broken clocks, creating stark, geometric shadows.

Scene 2 (8s) Narration: MARCH HARE: "No room! No room!" ALICE: "But there's plenty of room..." Visual Description: Low-angle shot from behind Alice's shoulder, her silhouette crisp and dark. The March Hare leans forward aggressively, his face half-covered in a sharp, triangular shadow, mouth wide as he yells. The Mad Hatter is a menacing, unmoving shape beside him.

Scene 3 (8s) Narration: ALICE: "I haven't had any yet, so—how can I have more?" Visual Description: A tight shot on Alice as she sits down. The March Hare shoves a teacup into the frame, filled with black, geometric crumbs that spill over. The lighting is harsh from the side, illuminating the confusion and defiance on Alice's face.

Scene 4 (8s) Narration: MAD HATTER: "You mean you can't have less. It's easy to have more of nothing!" Visual Description: Extreme close-up on the Mad Hatter's mouth as he speaks, which then breaks into a wide, manic grin. His teeth are sharp and stylized. A stark, black shadow cuts diagonally across his face. The background is a solid, bloody red.

Scene 5 (8s) Narration: MAD HATTER: "Tell us your riddle! If you don't have one, we'll give you one." ALICE: "I don't think—" MARCH HARE: "Then you shouldn't talk!" Visual Description: A rapid-cut sequence. The Hatter points a long, skeletal finger directly at the camera. Cut to Alice, a sliver of light across her eyes. Cut to the March Hare slamming his fist on the table, his face a mask of pure, joyous malice.

Scene 6 (8s) Narration: MAD HATTER: "Very well. Why is a raven like a writing desk?" Visual Description: An extreme close-up on one of the Mad Hatter's eyes. It glows with an eerie green light. For a split second, the reflections of a raven's silhouette and a sharp-angled writing desk are visible in his pupil.

Scene 7 (8s) Narration: ALICE: "I think I could figure that out..." MAD HATTER: "Have you guessed the answer yet?" Visual Description: Medium shot of Alice, her brow furrowed in concentration, the background a swirl of dark, abstract shapes. Cut to a close-up of the Hatter's fingers drumming impatiently on the table, each tap sending out a visible, geometric soundwave pulse.

Scene 8 (8s) Narration: ALICE: "No, I give up. What's the answer?" MAD HATTER: "I haven't the slightest idea." Visual Description: A shot over Alice's shoulder as she looks expectantly at the Hatter. The Hatter gives a dramatic, exaggerated shrug, his face a blank canvas except for a single, stark shadow. His silhouette seems to vibrate with nonchalance.

Scene 9 (8s) Narration: MAD HATTER: "Of course it is. Time and I fell out, you see. Ever since, he's refused to do what I ask." Visual Description: The Hatter turns his back to the camera, his long coat flaring out. His shadow stretches unnaturally across the entire table, a solid black shape that engulfs everything. The only color is the vibrant band on his hat.

Scene 10 (8s) Narration: MAD HATTER: "Time has stopped at precisely six o'clock. Eternally tea-time. A masterpiece of misery!" MARCH HARE: "Wonderful, isn't it?" Visual Description: Close-up on a battered, ornate pocket watch held in the Hatter's hand. Its hands are frozen, casting a long, sharp shadow. Cut to the March Hare's face, bisected by darkness, a wide, jagged grin spreading across the lit half.

Scene 11 (8s) Narration: ALICE: "But doesn't that mean you never… finish?" MAD HATTER: "Exactly! So when the table fills with dirty dishes—we simply move down one seat!" Visual Description: Whip pan shot. The camera follows the frantic motion as the Hatter, Hare, and the rolling Dormouse all slide one seat down. The movement is stylized with sharp motion lines and a momentary blurring of the background into hard-edged streaks of color.

Scene 12 (8s) Narration: ALICE: "This is the most ridiculous tea party I've ever been to!" MAD HATTER: "Thank you." MARCH HARE: "We try." Visual Description: Alice stands, her face a mask of pure frustration, lit from below to create a monstrous shadow on the tree behind her. Cut to a two-shot of the Hatter and Hare, who bow in unison with smug, sharp-angled smiles.

Scene 13 (8s) Narration: ALICE: "I think I'll be going now." (VOICEOVER) "Her vision blurs. The world melts around her as she collapses into darkness." Visual Description: Alice's point-of-view. The Hatter and Hare's faces begin to warp and stretch. The colors of the scene bleed and fracture into sharp, geometric shards. The world spins, and a black, angular shape expands from the center, consuming the screen until it's FADE TO BLACK.
