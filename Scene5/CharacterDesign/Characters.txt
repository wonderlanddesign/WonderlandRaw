Overall Visual Aesthetic & Art Style:

The art style is highly reminiscent of anime or manga, specifically with a strong influence from the "Persona" video game series' character design. Key indicators include:

Thick, angular black outlines: Defining all major forms and emphasizing features.
Vibrant, saturated colors: With clear, distinct blocks of color and limited blending.
High contrast shading: Achieved through sharp, geometric shadows, often in black or darker shades of the base color, creating a dramatic and graphic look. This gives a sense of strong light sources.
Expressive facial features: Particularly in Alice, with large, detailed eyes.
Dynamic posing: Both characters are presented in active, engaging postures.
The overall aesthetic is energetic, stylized, and modern while still referencing classic character archetypes.

Character 1: Alice

Appearance: Young female, likely in her late teens or early twenties, with a lean and somewhat athletic build.

Clothing: She is dressed in a recognizable "Alice in Wonderland" motif, but with a modern, somewhat edgy twist:

Dress: A deep royal blue puffed-sleeve dress with a white frilly apron over it.
The dress has a Peter Pan collar with a red bow.
The sleeves are short and extend just above the elbow, with white frilly cuffs.
The skirt is full and layered, showing white petticoat edging underneath the blue.
The apron is classic maid-style, with a ruffled edge and features two heart-shaped pockets/details with red centers.
Accessories:
A large red bow in her hair.
A smaller red bow at her neck.
White thigh-high stockings.
Red garters that hold up the stockings, creating a vibrant contrast.
Red Mary Jane style shoes with a small heel and a red bow on the strap.
She is holding a playing card, specifically the Ace of Hearts, in her left hand.

Long, wavy or lightly curled blonde hair, extending past her shoulders.
It appears to be a bright, almost golden blonde.

Summary for Consistency:

To maintain consistency for video generation, focus on:

Art Style: Keep the thick black outlines, high-contrast, block shading, and vibrant, saturated color palette.
Alice: Blonde hair (wavy/curly), blue eyes with sharp eyeliner, red bows (hair, neck, shoes), blue dress, white ruffled apron with heart details, white thigh-highs with red garters, red Mary Jane shoes.
White Rabbit: Black and white fur (patterned as seen), red eyes, blue top hat, blue tailcoat suit with vest and bow tie, golden pocket watch.
Character Expression/Posing: Alice has a gentle, slightly playful expression holding the card. The Rabbit is focused and slightly urgent, checking his watch. The poses are dynamic and clear.
