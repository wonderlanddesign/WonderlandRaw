video script: I fell into a shadow-drenched hall. A hundred doors, a hundred dead ends. Each lock a silent mockery, a stark black promise I couldn't reach. Then, a glint. On a glass table, a tiny golden key. It fit a door no bigger than my hand, revealing a vibrant, sun-drenched garden.

A bottle materialized, whispering "DRINK ME" in glowing crimson letters. I obeyed, my world warping and shrinking until I was smaller than a teacup. But the garden was still out of reach. A cake appeared, frosted with "EAT ME." One bite, and I shot upwards, a giant in a dollhouse.

Panic set in. I was a trapped titan. Hot, sharp tears fell like a torrential downpour, pooling and flooding the distorted checkerboard floor below. Then, I shrank once more, tumbling helplessly into the salty ocean I had just cried. Animals swam past me in the chaotic, swirling depths.

We scrambled ashore, a drenched and shivering menagerie on the edge of my own sorrow. A Mouse, a Dodo, a Duck, all looking lost. The Dodo declared a Caucus Race! A mad, circular dash with no start or finish. We all won and received odd, nonsensical prizes.

Then, a flicker of white. The Rabbit! He glanced back, his red eyes a challenge. I forgot everything else and plunged into the dark forest after him.

Style Design: The video will be rendered in a cell-shaded anime style heavily inspired by the video game "Killer is Dead." This is defined by a hyper-stylized, graphic aesthetic featuring thick, angular, and expressive black outlines on all characters and objects. The color palette is vibrant and saturated, applied in distinct, flat blocks with minimal blending. Shading is achieved with high-contrast, sharply defined geometric shadows, often in pure black, creating a dramatic and graphic look reminiscent of ink wash paintings. Light sources are strong and artificial, casting harsh highlights and deep shadows to enhance the dramatic, surreal atmosphere.

Storyboard design: Scene 1: Narration: I fell into a shadow-drenched hall. A hundred doors, a hundred dead ends. Each lock a silent mockery, a stark black promise I couldn't reach. Visual Description: Extreme low-angle shot looking up at Alice. She stands dwarfed in the center of a long, distorted hall with a warped checkerboard floor. The walls are a deep, saturated purple. Countless doors, defined by thick black outlines and glowing, stylized keyholes, recede into the distance. Sharp, geometric shadows stretch across the floor towards the viewer.

Scene 2: Narration: Then, a glint. On a glass table, a tiny golden key. It fit a door no bigger than my hand, revealing a vibrant, sun-drenched garden. Visual Description: A dramatic close-up on Alice’s hand reaching for a tiny, ornate golden key that emits a graphic lens flare. The background is a high-contrast black. The shot then cuts to a keyhole view, showing a brightly colored, hyper-saturated garden with stylized, angular flowers.

Scene 3: Narration: A bottle materialized, whispering "DRINK ME" in glowing crimson letters. I obeyed, my world warping and shrinking until I was smaller than a teacup. Visual Description: Dutch angle shot of Alice holding a small bottle. The "DRINK ME" text pulses with a crimson glow. As she drinks, graphic speed lines and a fish-eye lens effect warp the background. The scene ends with a close-up of her large eye, reflecting the rapidly growing room around her.

Scene 4: Narration: But the garden was still out of reach. A cake appeared, frosted with "EAT ME." One bite, and I shot upwards, a giant in a dollhouse. Visual Description: A low-angle shot of a tiny Alice looking up at an enormous, ornately decorated cake. Cut to a fast-paced upward tracking shot as Alice grows, her head breaking through the ceiling of the hall. The ceiling shatters in a graphic, stylized explosion of debris.

Scene 5: Narration: Panic set in. I was a trapped titan. Hot, sharp tears fell like a torrential downpour, pooling and flooding the distorted checkerboard floor below. Visual Description: Extreme close-up on Alice's giant, panicked eye. A single, enormous tear forms, rendered with a crystalline sheen. It falls in slow motion, depicted as a massive, graphic splash of blue hitting the floor, with the impact creating stylized white ripples against the dark water.

Scene 6: Narration: Then, I shrank once more, tumbling helplessly into the salty ocean I had just cried. Animals swam past me in the chaotic, swirling depths. Visual Description: Alice shrinks rapidly in a vortex of light and shadow, falling into the pool of tears. Underwater shot with a deep blue, high-contrast environment. A Dodo and Mouse, drawn with thick black lines, swim past her in a flurry of stylized bubbles and motion lines.

Scene 7: Narration: We scrambled ashore, a drenched and shivering menagerie on the edge of my own sorrow. A Mouse, a Dodo, a Duck, all looking lost. Visual Description: Medium shot of the group clambering onto a bank of land. Water drips from them in graphic, ink-like splatters. Their shadows are stark black shapes on the ground. Alice is on her knees, hair plastered to her face, looking bewildered at the equally soaked animals.

Scene 8: Narration: The Dodo declared a Caucus Race! A mad, circular dash with no start or finish. We all won and received odd, nonsensical prizes. Visual Description: A high-angle, wide shot of the characters running in a chaotic circle. The movement is emphasized with dynamic speed lines and motion blur. The colors are a swirl of vibrant, saturated tones. Quick cuts show close-ups of each character receiving a bizarre prize (e.g., a thimble, a single shoe).

Scene 9: Narration: Then, a flicker of white. The Rabbit! He glanced back, his red eyes a challenge. I forgot everything else and plunged into the dark forest after him. Visual Description: Alice's point-of-view, spotting the White Rabbit in the distance. A "snap zoom" focuses on his face as he looks back, his red eyes glowing intensely. He turns and leaps into a forest of black, angular trees. Alice immediately breaks into a dynamic run, chasing after him
